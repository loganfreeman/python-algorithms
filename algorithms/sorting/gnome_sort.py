    Implementation of gnome sort on a list and returns a sorted list.

    Gnome Sort Overview:
    ---------------------
    A sorting algorithm similar to insertion sort except that the element is moved to its proper place by a series of swaps.

    Time Complexity: O(n^2)

    Space Complexity: O(1) auxillary

    Stable: No
